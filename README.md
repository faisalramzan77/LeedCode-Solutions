# 🧠 Faisal's LeetCode Solution Collection

This repository contains all of my accepted LeetCode solutions written in **Python**. It serves as a structured, growing archive of problems I've solved while preparing for interviews and sharpening my data structures and algorithms skills. Every problem is solved with a focus on clarity, optimal complexity, and real world coding interview standards.



## 📌 Why This Repo?

*  Personal practice, revision, and problem-solving archive
*  Technical interview preparation (FAANG, startups, and top tech)
*  Improve understanding of core CS concepts (DP, Trees, Graphs, etc.)
*  Reusable reference to revisit optimal logic, edge cases, and patterns
*  Organized record of my daily/weekly consistency
*  Public resource for others to learn clean Python implementations
*  Help track long-term skill progression in data structures and algorithms



## 🎯 Goals

* Solve **300+** LeetCode problems in Python
* Focus mainly on Medium and Hard level problems, with a few Easy ones for warm up or fundamentals
* Solutions stored in a structured format that never needs manual editing
* Cover 99.9% of core CS topics needed for interviews
* Ensure code is consistently styled and easily navigable
* Keep everything self-contained and auto-explanatory without scripts
